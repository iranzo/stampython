# Contribute

All contributions are welcome.

If you're looking around to see what to contribute, please check 'TODO.md' as it contains information on the already identified missing features.

Whenever possible, also contribute UT to tests/ so the new functions can be validated.

- flake8 will test PEP8 validation
- testr or nosetests will check UT's in tests/ against the code (need to fix issue with testr not running tests sequentially in test file)
- markdown-lint will validate *.MD files
- `tox` can be used to validate both set of tests on your code before Pull Request

Thanks!
